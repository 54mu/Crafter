crafting bench



farming - 
- add fertilizer (pig drops bone randomly) 
- fertilizer is made out of bone - 
- fertilizer can make tall grass grow on regular grass
- bread - 3 bread in a row
- make sandwich with bread and cooked porkchop
- fertilizer used on saplings randomly make tree grow (make sapling growth a function)

make torches abm that checks if player in area
make furnace abm that checks if player in area


fishing
bows
fix full inventory collection deletion bug
3d character
boat
shiftclick with tool tries to place torch
make tnt hurt player
rewrite minecart - halfway - make go up and down hills
right click with tool places torch
if placed last node put another stack into hand
have falling node hurt player?
add a function to set a velocity goal to entities and then implement it with all entities
^make a value if below then stop?
colored chat messages
check if everyone is in bed before going to next night
- also lock player in bed until they get out or daytime
- create a function to check if a node or group is below

- chest minecart car
- player controls engine car
make entities push against players


open bugs:
fix torches not deleting particles when mounted node dug <- meta glitch?
--fixing with abm



possible applications:
causes object to magnetize towards player or other objects and stop after an inner radius
use for better item magnet?

if object:is_player() and object:get_player_name() ~= self.rider then
      local player_pos = object:getpos()
      pos.y = 0
      player_pos.y = 0
      
      local currentvel = self.object:getvelocity()
      local vel = vector.subtract(pos, player_pos)
      vel = vector.normalize(vel)
      local distance = vector.distance(pos,player_pos)
      distance = (1-distance)*10
      vel = vector.multiply(vel,distance)
      local acceleration = vector.new(vel.x-currentvel.x,0,vel.z-currentvel.z)
      
      
      if self.axis == "x"      then
            self.object:add_velocity(vector.new(acceleration.x,0,0))
      elseif self.axis == "z" then
            self.object:add_velocity(vector.new(0,0,acceleration.z))
      else
            self.object:add_velocity(acceleration)
      end
      
      --acceleration = vector.multiply(acceleration, -1)
      --object:add_player_velocity(acceleration)
end
